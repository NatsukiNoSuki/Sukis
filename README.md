Hey! Im a new person to github. I cant wait to see what i can get to.
I am a new developer to github. I mainly take scripts, credit the original owner, and recolor, reword, and change some code throughout the code to make things more enjoyable for people.
Someone in my team made a game website! if you would like to see it go here:
